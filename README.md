# Analyzing thread-safety in Java classes with CodeQL 

This repository accompanies the paper [Scalable Thread-Safety Analysis of Java Classes with CodeQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02022). 
It contains the CodeQL queries and experiments presented in the paper.

Furthermore, the queries have been merged into the main CodeQL repository (see this [PR](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/19539)). So, the queries are available via the standard CodeQL libraries as well.
